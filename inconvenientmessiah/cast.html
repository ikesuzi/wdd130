    <h2>Jesus Christ at the Pinnacle of the Temple</h2>
    <p>Satan knew the temple was the center of religious life for Israel’s people. It was the temple to which the promised Messiah must come. Many were even at that moment coming and going from their worship, many who through their traditions and disbelief would never accept Jesus as their Redeemer. The temptation to Jesus could be paraphrased this way: “Why not cast yourself down in a dramatic way and then when the angels bear you up, as the scriptures say they must, legions will follow you and believe? They need you. You need them—to save their souls. These are covenant people. How better to help them see than to cast yourself off this holy temple unharmed and unafraid. The Messiah has indeed come.”
        The temptation here is even more subtle than the first. It is a temptation of the spirit, of a private hunger more real than the need for bread. Would God save him? Would he? Is Jesus to have divine companionship in this awesome ministry he now begins? Perhaps before venturing forth he ought to get final reassurance. Why not get spiritual confirmation, obtain a loyal congregation, and answer Satan with one appeal to God’s power? Right now. The easy way. Off the temple spire.
        But Jesus refuses the temptation of the spirit. Denial and restraint are also part of divine preparation. He would gain followers and he would receive reassurance. But not this way. He had not yet earned the converts nor the comfort he would so richly deserve. His ministry had hardly begun. The rewards would come eventually. But even the Son of God had to wait.
        And so I ask you to be patient in things of the Spirit. Perhaps your life has been different from mine, but I doubt it. I have had to struggle to know my standing before God. As a teenager I found it hard to pray and harder to fast. My mission was not easy. I struggled as a student only to find that I had to struggle afterwards, too. As an adult, I have wept and ached for guidance. It seems no worthy accomplishment has ever come easily for me, but I’m living long enough to be grateful for that.
        It is ordained that we come to know our worth as a child of God without something as dramatic as a leap from the pinnacle of the temple. All but a prophetic few must go about God’s work in very quiet, very unspectacular ways. And as you labor to know him, and to know that he knows you; as you invest your time—and inconvenience—in quiet, unassuming service, you will indeed find that “his angels [have] charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up.” (Matt. 4:6.) It may not come quickly. It probably won’t come quickly, but there is purpose in the time it takes. Cherish your spiritual burdens because God will converse with you through them and will use you to do his work if you carry them well.
        If sometimes the harder you try, the harder it gets, take heart. So it has been with the best people who ever lived.
        Now, in some frustration, Satan moves right to the point. If he cannot tempt physically and cannot tempt spiritually, he will simply make an outright proposition to the Savior—and to us. From a high mountain where they might overlook the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, Satan says, “All these things will I give thee, if thou will fall down and worship me.”
        Satan makes up for lack of subtlety here with the grandeur of his offer. Never mind that these kingdoms are not his to give. He simply asks of the great Jehovah, God of Heaven and Earth, “What is your price? Cheap bread you resist. Messianic drama you resist, but no man can resist this world’s wealth. Name your price.” Satan is proceeding under his first article of faithlessness—the unequivocal belief that you can buy anything in this world for money.
        Jesus will one day rule the world. He will govern every principality and power in it. He will be King of Kings and Lord of Lords. But not this way. Indeed, to arrive at that point at all, he has to follow a most inconvenient course. His arrival at the throne of grace is to lead through travail and sorrow and sacrifice. Some seven centuries earlier Isaiah had prophesied of him:
        “He is a man despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
        “He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities.
        “He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and … openeth not his mouth.” (Isa. 53:3, 5, 7.)
        Should earning our place in the kingdom of God be so difficult as that? Surely there is an easier way. Can’t we buy our way in? Every man and every woman does have a price, don’t they? Sometimes we wonder. But no, not everyone does have a price. Some things can’t be purchased. Money and fame and earthly glory are not our eternal standards. Indeed, money and fame and earthly glory can, if we are not careful, lead to eternal torment.
        As much as this Church and you and I as individuals need the resources to feed and clothe ourselves and further the work of the kingdom, we do not need to sell our souls to get them. In the world today, there are many who try to involve others in unwise purchases or “once in a lifetime” opportunities. These kinds of opportunities often offer something for nothing—convenient ways of making a lot of money quickly, without much effort. Unfortunately, many trusting people have been misled by scheming, deceiving promoters. We can get our share of the earth’s bounties, but not this way.
        Appropriate, necessary income, studies at school, or any other honest endeavor is important. To work hard, to try earnestly, and to deserve good things to happen is worth the effort and worth the wait. And they will happen, often sooner than you think. But it won’t be easy, and it won’t be convenient.
        It is not easy to go without physical gratifications, spiritual assurances, or material possessions, but sometimes we must since there is no guarantee of convenience written into our Christian covenant. We must work hard and do right, and sometime our chance will come. And when we’ve tried, and waited for what seemed never to be ours, then the angels may come and minister unto us. (See Matt. 4:11.) For that ministration in your life I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
