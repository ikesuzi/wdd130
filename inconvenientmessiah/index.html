            <h4>There are certain responsibilities we have to face when we choose to follow Jesus Christ. In the Savior’s life and in ours, Satan fights against discipline with temptations of an easier way, with an offer of “convenient Christianity.” It is a temptation Jesus resisted, and so must we. Life was very inconvenient for him, and, I believe it will often be so for us when we take upon us his name. Probably the most easily recognizable kind of evil is that which simply openly rebels against heaven, as Satan rebelled before the world was created—willful, opposition to God. From the time of Cain to today’s domestic and international hostilities, Satan has attempted to lure children of promise into violent, destructive rejection of the gospel and its teachings. These are harsh sins which the world has known only too well. But there is another, more subtle strategy used by Satan which is not so violent, not so vengeful, and at first glance not so vicious. But that’s where the problem lies, because this second approach is more sinister. It comes in the soft enticement of convenience. It says to every would-be Christian—enjoy the temptation of comfort and ease.
                Remember when Jesus “had fasted forty days and forty nights, and had communed with God, he was afterwards an hungered, and was left to be tempted of the devil. “And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. “But Jesus answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. “Then Jesus was taken up into the holy city, and the Spirit setteth him on the pinnacle of the temple. “Then the devil came unto him and said, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written, he shall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. “Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. “And again, Jesus was in the Spirit and it taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them. “And the devil came unto him again, and said, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. “Then said Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, 
                Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth him.” (Matt. 4:1–11.) I believe tempting thoughts come to us day after day, hour after hour—even among the Latter-day Saints. And because for us, like Christ, these temptations are far more subtle than the more obvious temptations, let me comment briefly on them.</h4>
