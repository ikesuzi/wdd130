    <p>Whatever else Satan may do, he will certainly appeal to our appetites. 
        Far better for him to try to use our natural needs than struggle to create 
        artificial ones in us. Jesus experienced the real and very understandable hunger 
        for food by which he would sustain his mortal life. He has fasted for forty days 
        and forty nights. Why not eat? He seems ready to break his fast, or surely must soon. 
        Why not simply turn the stones to bread and eat? The temptation is not in the eating. 
        He has eaten before, he will soon eat again, he must eat for the rest of his mortal life.
         The temptation comes in Satan’s suggestion to do it this way—to get relief the easy way,
          by abuse of power and without a willingness to wait for the right time and the right way.
           It is the temptation to be the convenient Messiah. Why do things the hard way? Why deny 
           yourself satisfaction when with only a slight compromise you might enjoy this much-needed 
           nourishment? But Christ will not ask selfishly for unearned bread. He will postpone 
           gratification indefinitely if necessary, rather than satisfy appetite with what is not his.
            Sexual expression is also a high and holy physical gratification we were designed and 
            created to enjoy. It is as natural as it is appealing. It is given of God to make us like God.
             But it is not ours without price. Not instantly. Not conveniently. Not with a comfortable 
             corruption of eternal powers. It is to be earned, over time, and with discipline. 
             It, like every good thing, is God’s right to give, not Satan’s. When faced with that 
             inherent appetite, a disciple of Christ must be willing to say, “Yes, but not this way.” 
             In time, with love, and within the bonds of matrimony. The right and proper and sanctified 
             physical relationship of a man and a woman is as much a part—indeed more a part—of God’s 
             plan for us than is the eating of our daily bread. But there is no convenient Messiah. 
             Salvation comes only through discipline and sacrifice. To young and old alike,
              I plead with you not to yield to the temptations of the flesh.</p>
